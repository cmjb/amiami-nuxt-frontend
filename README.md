# Amiami frontend

This is a faster loading version of the amiami frontend based on Nuxt SSR. This needs data supplied through Postgres via https://github.com/cmjb/amiami-scrape.

This is a proof of concept, and was only done to see if it was possible. Source is license under MIT.

This project uses Nuxt 3, Vuetify 3 and Prisma.
